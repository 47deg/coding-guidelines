# Java Coding Standards

The purpose of the 47 Degrees Java Coding Standards is to create a collaboration baseline; helpful for scenarios where many people are creating, modifying, and contributing to the same project. The end goal is unity, consistency, and the notion that a single entity worked on the project.

Java applications developed at 47 Degrees should follow the Code Conventions for the Java Programming Language as outlined on http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/codeconv-138413.html

47 Degrees uses the Java Programming Language and Java Related Technologies in different scenarios and applications. As a norm 47 Degrees follows industry standards and notifying of any deviation of this document from these standards will be welcomed.
